In an electrifying talk, she shares the lessons she learned from her campaign for governor of Georgia -- and some advice on how to change the world. "Be aggressive about your ambition," Abrams says.

   Welcome to BrightSpeaking.

   I am Lorna Ye, a writer, blogger, and coach on writing and public speaking. I have a Ph.D. Degree in Communication. In 2017, I founded Bright Learning, LLC and created BrightSpeaking website, where I share my thoughts, experience, tips and hacks, and resources on everything related to English communication.

   It is not intended to provide standard instructions on how to communicate–as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to communication. Rather, I am hoping it offers practical tips and suggestions that help readers, especially those who are non-native English speakers, be better communicators.

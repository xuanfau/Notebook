The American Society for Microbiologists hosted its first international 'Agar Art' challenge in which microbiologists from around the world used various microbes and germs to create beautiful works of art in Petri dishes. The submissions included famous paintings and classical artworks like Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' as well as original microbe paintings.

The scientists used nutritious agar jelly as a "canvas" for their colorful paintings. While they do add an element of randomness as they grow, they can also do things that paint cannot – some of these Petri dish artworks emit bio fluorescent light under certain conditions, while others, guided by the scientists, grew into perfect tree-branch patterns or jelly-fish tentacles.

For more about the process behind unique art like this, read about the work of Tasha Sturm, a microbiologist who used an agar dish to capture the germs on an eight-year-old boy's hand.
